Survey Consumer beliefs/opinions about AI

Today, digital assistants are most commonly used at home. Over 40% of business
execs use their digital assistants throughout the whole day, reporting usage while
driving, commuting, and working. Across all respondents, at any time of day, the
top benefits of digital assistants are utilitarian (i.e. “it saves me time,” “it helps me
get things done,” and “it reminds me of calendar events”).

Required for mass adoption
One of the biggest barriers facing the integration of consumer
services continues to be fragmented technology development.
Each brand develops a different platform, generates different
data, and different learnings while working in a silo. It
comes down to competitive advantage and wanting one’s
own platform to “win.” Ok Google, Siri, Cortana, Facebook
Messenger, and Alexa are the result of this practice.
Our panel experts predicted two tactics that would rapidly
increase the adoption rate of AI services:
1.
Create a “universal chat” platform:
a destination
where all conversations with AI bots would take
place. This would allow one central platform for
development, data collection, and analysis.
2.
Create a “universal footprint”:
in a world where
privacy is a top concern of consumers, PwC Innovation
Lead, Data & Analytics, Anand Rao theorizes that
consumers would be more comfortable if they could
control when and for how long the data they give to AI
platforms exists. For instance, whatever conversation
a consumer has with an AI, that data would only be
available to brands for a short period, then be erased
at a time of the consumer’s choosing. This would help
increase adoption and raise confidence when it comes
to highly sensitive activities like banking, healthcare,
and business management.
